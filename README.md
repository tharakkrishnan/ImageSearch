# Image search

### Installation
- To try it out, clone the repository. Make sure to have opencv 3.0.0 installed. 
- cd src
- ./run.sh

### Problem statement
The directory ImageSearch/modified_images contain images that are modified in various ways. The original images are on an account in Flickr. The modified images are scaled, rotated, color-changed, contrast-changed versions of those on Flickr. The software will try to get the best match for the modified images.
